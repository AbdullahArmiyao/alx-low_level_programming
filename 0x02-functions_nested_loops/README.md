Basically today's project is all about defining the functions

First make sure to type all the functions  in the main.h file
it should all be in 

#ifndef MAIN.H
#def MAIN.H

/* Functions go here */

#endif

Once you do this, define each function in each task like I did in my code.

				TASKS
-----------------====================================------------------------

0. Just use the _putchar function already predefined in main.h
	For this we are not defining _putchar, we are just using it to print each letter of _putchar

1. Using loops, use _putchar to print lowercasen alphabets from a-z in the givin function.....note you are just defining the function since you declared it in main.h

2. Same as the first but in this scenario you have to print 10 lines

3. Define the function to check for lowercase characters

4. Define the function to check for alphabetic character

5. Define the function to print the sign of a number

6. Define the function to compute the absolute value of an integer

7. Define the function to print the last digit of a number

8. Define the function to print every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59

9. Define the function to print the 9 times table, starting with 0

10. Define the function to add 2 numbers

11. Define the function to print all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line

100. Define the function to print n times table 

101. Define the function to add multiples of 3 or 5 as it loops through from 1 to 1024

102. Define the function to print the fibonacci numbers less than 50

103. Define the function to print the fibonacci numbers and when the sum is more than 4000000, break. Add the sum to total sum if divisible by 2

104. Once you look at the code you will understand it :)
